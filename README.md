# Fediverse Poll Results Viewer

![An example poll rendered by my tool. Just a basic Bootstrap-styled card with the description of the poll and 4 options showing the votes for each option with a bar colored based on the results.](public/images/thumbnails/thumbnail-1200x800.png)

A proof-of-concept tool that lets you view results of an ongoing poll. A possible use is linking to a page with the results of your poll instead of having to add "view results" as one of the options for your poll.
